include ExceptionLogger

Description:

    The layout generator creates a basic stylesheet and layout
    which will give some structure to a starting Rails app.

    The generator takes one argument which will be the name of the
    layout and stylesheet files.

Examples:

    ./script/generate logged_exceptions

    Once this is run, numerous files will be installed.

    Add the following line in app/controllers/application.rb before 'helper :all'

    include ExceptionLogger
     
    # EXAMPLE:
    # ========       
    # class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
	#  include ExceptionLogger
	#  helper :all # include all helpers, all the time
